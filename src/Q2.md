# Differences between arrays and Linked lists

## 1.<ins>Memory Allocation</ins>

### Arrays
- **Contiguous Memory**: Arrays use a single, continuous block of memory.
- **Fixed Size**:Arrays have a predetermined size at creation time.

### Linked Lists
- **Dynamic Memory**: Memory is allocated separately for each node as needed.
- **Scattered Storage**: Nodes can be located anywhere in memory, connected by pointers.
- **Flexible Growth**: Lists can grow or shrink one node at a time without relocating existing data.

## 2. <ins>Performance</ins>

### Arrays
- **Random Access**: O(1) - Elements can be accessed directly by index.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Lower overhead since no pointers are stored.
- **Cache Locality**: Better performance due to contiguous memory.

### Linked Lists
- **Sequential Access**: O(n) - Must traverse from the beginning to find elements.
- **Memory Overhead**: Each node requires extra space for the reference to the next node.
- **Cache Performance**: Generally poorer due to scattered memory locations.

## 2. <ins>Insertion and deletion operations</ins>
### Arrays
- **Beginning Insertion/Deletion**: O(n) - Requires shifting all other elements.
- **Middle Insertion/Deletion**: O(n) - Requires shifting subsequent elements.
- **End Insertion/Deletion**: O(1) for most cases.


### Linked Lists
- **Beginning Insertion/Deletion**: O(1) - Simply update the head pointer.
- **Middle Insertion/Deletion**: O(1) after finding the position .
- **End Insertion/Deletion**: O(1) if a tail pointer is maintained, otherwise O(n).

In summary,arrays give fast access but slow modification, while linked lists give fast modification but slow access.
